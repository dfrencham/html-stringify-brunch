# html-stringify-brunch

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/dfrencham/html-stringify-brunch.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Adds stringify pass-through support to brunch (really useful if you use AMD modules, and you want to load them via text.js).

This means you can have your HTML templates pass through the Brunch pipeline - allowing them to be wrapped in AMD define statements, and combined into a single file.

## Install
Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save html-stringify-brunch`.

Or, do manual install by adding `"html-stringify-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.

## Usage

### Example - using templated views with AMD module loader

This example assumes your app is laid out as follows:

```
app\
  assets\
    index.html
  components\
    example-component\
      view.html
      viewmodel.js
    example-component-2\
      view.html
      viewmodel.js
  styles\
    main.css
  application.js
```
Note that there is a **components** folder, containing multiple components. The goal is to have the component html files combined, and wrapped with AMD define statements in a way that **text.js** can consume.

When configuring your brunch build, do the following:

1. In your module definition is set to **'amd'**.
2. In the **files** section, add an entry for **templates** with a joinTo pointed at your component folder.
3. In the **modules** section, set **wrapper** to a custom function (as shown). Note that in the case of an item existing in our component folder, we use **text!** in our define statement - allowing text.js to load the module.

```coffeescript
module.exports = config:
  files:
    javascripts:
      joinTo:
      	'app.js': /^app/
      	'vendor.js': /^(vendor)[\\/]/
    stylesheets: joinTo: 'app.css'
    templates:
        precompile: true
        joinTo: 'templates.js': /^app\/components/
  modules:
    wrapper: (path, data) ->
      if path.indexOf('app\/components) == 0')
          staticPath = path.replace /^app\/components/, 'text!components'
          """
  require.define({#{staticPath}: function(exports, require, module) {
    #{data}
  }});\n\n
          """
      else
          """
  require.define({#{path}: function(exports, require, module) {
    #{data}
  }});\n\n
          """
    definition: 'amd'
```
